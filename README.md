# Machine-Learning-Based-Book-Recommender-Engine-in-Python
This project presents a web app that gives book suggestions to users based on their likes and ratings. It uses two methods to make the suggestions: popularity-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The first method suggests books that are rated high by everyone, while the second method suggests books that are similar to a chosen book, based on other users' ratings. The web app is built with Flask, a Python web framework, and uses data about books and ratings. The data is processed to fit the methods. The web app has two features- one that shows the popularity-based suggestions, and another that takes a book name and shows the collaborative filtering suggestions. The goal of this project is to create a useful and easy book recommender system that can help online bookstores or libraries in giving personalized book tips to their customers, based on their preferences.
